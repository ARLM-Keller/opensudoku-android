=== Puzzles generated by gnome-sudoku ===

These puzzles were generated by [http://live.gnome.org/GnomeSudoku gnome-sudoku] - same generator was used to create original puzzles in game. Please note that these puzzles are rather easy.

*2009-09-16* - I've generated new puzzles as previous puzzles here were wrong (all files contained one identical set of hard puzzles). Sorry for the inconvenience.
